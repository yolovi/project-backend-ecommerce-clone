## <h1 align="center"> ‚öôÔ∏è Description | Development </h1>

In the backend project, we will combine the knowledge acquired in node + express technologies, as well as mysql/sequelize to develop an API. The proposed exercise is an e-commerce application where CRUD operations will be implemented for users, products, orders, and categories.

### Challenge üé¢ & Skills Achieved

After analyzing the project requirements, I have created a REST API capable of the following points:

- User registration using Bcrypt.
- User login + token + middleware.
- Implementing CRUD operations.
- At least one Many-to-Many relationship and one One-to-Many relationship.
- Utilization of seeders.
- Validations.

Note that this project was completed within a ten-day timeframe as part of an exercise for The Bridge Valencia's FullStack Bootcamp.

For this project I have made a diagram creating different tables and the relationship between them (1:N, N:M, N:M).

It has been a challenging project, with the most complicated aspects being the many-to-many relationships and validations, such as checking if an ID exists when creating an order or requesting a specific product. The logic in these cases is complex.

## TODO lists ‚úî
#### CRUD is the acronym for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE. These terms describe the four essential operations for creating and managing persistent data elements, mainly in relational and NoSQL databases.

### Product CRUD

- [‚úî] Endpoint to create a product
- [‚úî] Endpoint to update a product
- [‚úî] The endpoint to retrieve products should also display the category or categories they belong to
- [‚úî] Endpoint to retrieve a product by its ID
- [‚úî] Filter to search for a product by name
- [‚úî] Filter to search for a product by price
- [‚úî] Filter to sort products by price from highest to lowest
- [‚úî] Implement validation when creating a product to ensure all fields are filled, returning a message if not
- [‚úî] Only authenticated users can create, update, and delete products.

### Category CRUD

- [‚úî] Endpoint to create a category
- [‚úî] Endpoint to update a category
- [‚úî] Endpoint to delete a category
- [‚úî] The endpoint to view all categories should display the products they contain
- [‚úî] Create an endpoint to retrieve a category by its ID
- [‚úî] Filter to search for a category by name

### Order CRUD

- [‚úî] Create an endpoint to view orders along with the products they contain
- [‚úî] Create an endpoint to create orders

### User CRUD

- [‚úî] Endpoint to register a user using bcrypt
- [‚úî] Endpoint for user login (using bcrypt + JWT)
- [‚úî] Endpoint to retrieve information about the logged-in user, including their orders and the products within each order
- [‚úî] Endpoint for user logout
- [‚úî] Implement validation when creating a user to ensure all fields are filled, returning a message if not

### Seeders

- [‚úî] Create 5 products with a seeder

### Custom Extras Implemented

- [‚úî] ORDER: Improved the create order endpoint: if the user provides a non-existent product ID, it generates an error and informs the user that the product in their order was not found.
- [‚úî] SEEDER: Create a seeder for users (8) and categories (4)
- [‚úî] PRODUCT: Display products in ascending order of prices
- [‚úî] PRODUCT: Filter by price range
- [‚úî] PRODUCT: Update product > display an error message if the ID does not exist
- [‚úî] PRODUCT: Insert product in an order > display an error message if the ID does not exist

## IMPLEMENT ‚úî
## Future Roadmap. Extras:

Role implementation:
- [ ] Create an Admin role and only allow users with that role to create, update, and delete products.
- [ ] Research what multer middleware is and implement it to attach images when creating or updating products.

CRUD reviews
- [ ] The endpoint to retrieve reviews should display the user who made the review
- [ ] Update the endpoint to retrieve all products to display the products along with their categories and reviews
- [ ] Update the endpoint to retrieve a product by ID to display the product along with its categories and reviews

Others:
- [ ] PRODUCT: get all by name. Retrieve all products that match a part of the name passed as a parameter.
- [ ] USER: Display all users (Admin)
- [ ] CATEGORY: Display all categories
- [ ] CATEGORY: Create, update, and delete (Admin only)
- [ ] VALIDATIONS: Add Regex validations for email and password
- [ ] CONFIRMATION EMAIL. Add send email from sever
- [ ] API testing.
